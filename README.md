# HW6-Weather-Dashboard

In this assignment we had to create a dashboard to see the current forecast of the day and the future 5 day forecast. 
to complete this assignment we used the skills we learned this week in javasript that include JSON, Fetch, getting 
API keys from the inteernet and applying them to our work.
